<h3> Alligator whisperer </h3>
Bryant has a secret talent of calling alligators. It just goes to show that Matt Bryant is a jack of all trades and he should be in the Falcons ring of honor. Bryant frequently calls Alligators while golfing at Arthur Blank's golf course in Hilton Head. This may seem quite irrelevant to his career in the Falcons but it just goes to show that Bryant is talented on and off the field.
